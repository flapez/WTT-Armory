The AN-94 has the unique feature of delaying felt recoil for the first two rounds. This increases hit probability in adverse combat conditions. The AN-94 offers a unique two-shot burst function at a stated 1800 rounds per minute, with the second shot firing very close to the first round. This feature is often known as the hyperburst mechanism.",

The KAC's lower receiver, holding the magazine and trigger assembly, is essentially a shortened M16 rifle lower receiver, which makes the basic operating controls familiar to many potential users. However, the cartridge, upper receiver, and operating mechanism are all new designs by KAC. The KAC PDW uses a completely side-folding stock, unlike the M16 and M4 designs which have their main operating spring in a tube in the stock, and therefore can only partially telescope, and not fold sideways at all, unless specialized hardware is installed. The KAC PDW has two gas pistons tapping hot gas from the barrel to operate its mechanism, located on the top left and right sides of the bolt carrier. The single mainspring is located on top, between the two gas pistons.",

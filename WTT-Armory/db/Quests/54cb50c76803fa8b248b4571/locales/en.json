When the blockade kicked off and most of the reserve base boys ditched the place Glukhar and his crew of scavengers busted into the weapons testing area. Grabbed whatever they could get their filthy hands on. Most of that gear is long gone used up or trashed. But word is the scraps they left behind are about to be moved. Glukhar’s planning to spread his rot further across our land.",
    "687314e1ee500b06711955a2 startedMessageText": "I need you to hit the 3rd floor Armory in the Black Pawn building. Find whatever’s left of what those thieves took. That’s government property and it belongs back with us. The issue is that things are a little too hot right now so I will need you to stash the prototype in the black SUV at the USEC Camp over at the Priozersk Nature Reserve. Once my guys retrieve it, my garrison will make sure you get a fat payday for your trouble.",
    "687314e1ee500b06711955a2 successMessageText": "Nice work warrior. You pulled those goods out before Glukhar’s dogs could move them. Our homeland owes you one. Here’s your cut. Now get lost.",

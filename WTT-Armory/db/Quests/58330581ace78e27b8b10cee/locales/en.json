He’s after some old game console and a bootleg Star Wars DVD he stashed somewhere at the Health Resort. Problem is, I was three vodkas deep when he told me the room number, so I got no clue where exactly. You’ll need to sniff around the resort’s fancy suites y’know, the ones with the plush carpets and overpriced views. Once you’ve nabbed the goods, drop ‘em off at the mini theater in Interchange, in the back somewhere by the poster he said. Don’t even think about popping that DVD in for a watch or selling it for a quick buck, don't try fucking with that  game console either. This guy’s obsessive, and I ain’t dealing with his tantrums. They're messy; do this clean, and we’ll talk more work.\"\n\n",

Dropped ‘em off at the mini theater like I asked, too? My client’s gonna be over the moon, probably crying into his vintage popcorn. You’ve got some skills, operator. Stick around, nice to have someone that don't fuck up a simple fetch job. Now go clean your gear or something.",

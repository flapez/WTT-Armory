The AN-94 has the unique feature of delaying felt recoil for the first two rounds. This increases hit probability in adverse combat conditions. The AN-94 offers a unique two-shot burst function at a stated 1800 rounds per minute, with the second shot firing very close to the first round. This feature is often known as the hyperburst mechanism.",

However, the cartridge, upper receiver, and operating mechanism are all new designs by KAC. The KAC PDW uses a completely side-folding stock, unlike the M16 and M4 designs which have their main operating spring in a tube in the stock, and therefore can only partially telescope, and not fold sideways at all, unless specialized hardware is installed. The KAC PDW has two gas pistons tapping hot gas from the barrel to operate its mechanism, located on the top left and right sides of the bolt carrier. The single mainspring is located on top, between the two gas pistons.",

The UCP operates by roller-delayed blowback. The external design of the weapon appears to have been borrowed from the P2000, including ambidextrous controls, interchangeable backstraps, and a MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail for accessories. It was designed to be the companion sidearm to the MP7 PDW, using the same 4.6×30mm bottlenecked cartridge. In this sense, the UCP was a competitor to FN Herstal's Five-seveN in the same context that the MP7 rivals the P90.",

  "68e0002a0d6a4dab56810fbd Description": "The Valmet M78 is the RPK-style heavy barreled squad support weapon pattern of the Finnish AK. It was initially developed as the M74 cavalry machine gun for Finnish military service, but never adopted. If it had, it would have been chambered for 7.62x39mm. For export, the company offered that caliber as well as 5.56x45mm and 7.62x51mm. That experimental design would serve as the basis for the commercial export M78. Because these were imported before 1986, it was legal to manufacture them into transferrable machine guns. -Ian McCollum",

The AN-94 has the unique feature of delaying felt recoil for the first two rounds. This increases hit probability in adverse combat conditions. The AN-94 offers a unique two-shot burst function at a stated 1800 rounds per minute, with the second shot firing very close to the first round.

The KAC's lower receiver, holding the magazine and trigger assembly, is essentially a shortened M16 rifle lower receiver, which makes the basic operating controls familiar to many potential users. However, the cartridge, upper receiver, and operating mechanism are all new designs by KAC. The KAC PDW uses a completely side-folding stock, unlike the M16 and M4 designs which have their main operating spring in a tube in the stock, and therefore can only partially telescope, and not fold sideways at all, unless specialized hardware is installed. The KAC PDW has two gas pistons tapping hot gas from the barrel to operate its mechanism, located on the top left and right sides of the bolt carrier. The single mainspring is located on top, between the two gas pistons.",

  "68e0002a0d6a4dab56810fbd description": "The Valmet M78 is the RPK-style heavy barreled squad support weapon pattern of the Finnish AK. It was initially developed as the M74 cavalry machine gun for Finnish military service, but never adopted. If it had, it would have been chambered for 7.62x39mm. For export, the company offered that caliber as well as 5.56x45mm and 7.62x51mm. That experimental design would serve as the basis for the commercial export M78. Because these were imported before 1986, it was legal to manufacture them into transferrable machine guns. -Ian McCollum",

You can fill our coffers as needed another way. You see as of right now my... management doesn't see things here as particularly noteworthy or dangerous. I'd like to put a bug in their ear with evidence to prove that we need some heavier firepower to protect us in the region. I'm thinking some standard shells for the BTR I've seen wandering around the area should disappear from the reserve base arsenal and reappear at the place where the BTR stops a couple hundred meters north of the sawmill. You might find some around their motorpool, they have to unload the guns to work on them after all. As always, you'll find your pockets full after the fact. See to it.",

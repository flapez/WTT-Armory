The AN-94 has the unique feature of delaying felt recoil for the first two rounds. This increases hit probability in adverse combat conditions. The AN-94 offers a unique two-shot burst function at a stated 1800 rounds per minute, with the second shot firing very close to the first round. This feature is often known as the hyperburst mechanism.",

However, the cartridge, upper receiver, and operating mechanism are all new designs by KAC. The KAC PDW uses a completely side-folding stock, unlike the M16 and M4 designs which have their main operating spring in a tube in the stock, and therefore can only partially telescope, and not fold sideways at all, unless specialized hardware is installed. The KAC PDW has two gas pistons tapping hot gas from the barrel to operate its mechanism, located on the top left and right sides of the bolt carrier. The single mainspring is located on top, between the two gas pistons.",

The UCP operates by roller-delayed blowback. The external design of the weapon appears to have been borrowed from the P2000, including ambidextrous controls, interchangeable backstraps, and a MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail for accessories. It was designed to be the companion sidearm to the MP7 PDW, using the same 4.6×30mm bottlenecked cartridge. In this sense, the UCP was a competitor to FN Herstal's Five-seveN in the same context that the MP7 rivals the P90.",

Back when I was running things at the Factory I overheard my boss talking about a rare antique smoothbore pistol. Kept it in a fancy display case. Word is it was gifted to some accountant he dealt with. I want that piece for myself now. Something about the craft of it calls to me. Check the Black Knight building over in Military Reserve. That's where that accountant's office used to be. Find it and bring it back. I’ll make it worth your while.",

  "6833b8bc6f8ce71072c4e703 description": "Contractor, we have a humanitarian crisis brewing. Hostile factions are targeting UN aid convoys in Woods - but the media needs proof. Plant 5 UNTAR tags near some faction hotspots, put them on a few executed bodies. When the world sees the BEAR and USEC are decimating the blue helmets, donations to our 'operations' will triple. Saving lives through proper optics.",
  "6833b8bc6f8ce71072c4e703 startedMessageText": "Plant the tags, stage the bodies, vanish. If they trace this back or you get caught, you're a rogue actor.",

Retrieve it from their abandoned armored vehicle in Streets. Its contents are of high value to us: tax havens, embargoed tech sales, shipping manifests. This info, in the right hands, could ‘inspire’ Stockholm to reallocate UN aid budgets to our operations. A shame if their arms deals with TerraGroup leaked…",
